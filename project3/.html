    <h1>--problems about earth--</h1>
    <h2>2025</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>--explaining--</h3>
    <p>what will the world look like in 2025? that was a question we all asked before 2025 but we are already there so lets talk about
        good and bad things about year <b>2025</b></p>
    <p>in 2025 there are new invenstions like self driving cars using cameras or even better lidars,<br>
         there is fastest train in japan whitch can go up to 300km in a hour, there is floating trains to witch is moving with magnetic feilds<br>
        but there are lot of problems with 2025 too, as we know there is 2 war and its extreme becouse we are on a tip to start world war,<br>
    there is war with ukrine and russia, palestine and isrile, america stopped giving supplies to ukrine in hope of russia stpping war but<br>
it got worst. there is problems about earths felid whitch protects us from radiated light, but pepole are smoking and driving cars with motor<br>
or cars that needs more gas whitch can couse lot of smoke witch is slowly destroing earths force feild</p>

<h3>--we are tryng to find cure for cancer--</h3>
<p>Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles<br>
     the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries<br>
      (through 2021) and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (through 2022).<br>
       In 2025, 2,041,910 new cancer cases and 618,120 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States.<br>
        The cancer mortality rate continued to decline through 2022, averting nearly 4.5 million deaths since 1991 because<br>
         of smoking reductions, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment. Yet alarming disparities<br>
          persist; Native American people bear the highest cancer mortality, including rates that are two to three times<br>
           those in White people for kidney, liver, stomach, and cervical cancers. Similarly, Black people have<br>
            two-fold higher mortality than White people for prostate, stomach, and uterine corpus cancers.<br>
             Overall cancer incidence has generally declined in men but has risen in women, narrowing the male-to-female<br>
              rate ratio (RR) from a peak of 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.57-1.61) in 1992 to 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.12)<br>
               in 2021. However, rates in women aged 50-64 years have already surpassed those in men (832.5 vs. 830.6 per 100,000), and<br>
                younger women (younger than 50 years) have an 82% higher incidence rate than their male counterparts<br>
                 (141.1 vs. 77.4 per 100,000), up from 51% in 2002. Notably, lung cancer incidence in women surpassed that in<br>
                  men among people younger than 65 years in 2021 (15.7 vs. 15.4 per 100,000; RR, 0.98, p = 0.03). In summary,<br>
                   cancer mortality continues to decline, but future gains are threatened by rampant racial inequalities and a<br>
                    growing burden of disease in middle-aged and young adults, especially women. Continued progress will require<br>
                     investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially for Native American and Black individuals.</p>

<h3>--we are tryng to clean the seas--</h3>
<p>From the icy splendour of the Arctic to the inky depths of the Mariana ocean trench, plastic waste is threatening our seas,<br>
     killing our wildlife and polluting our food chain. The facts are undeniable: each year more than 8 million tonnes of plastic enter our<br>
      oceans. According to one estimate, 99 per cent of seabirds will have ingested plastic by the middle of this century.<br>
    It is a sobering picture, but working together we can change this narrative. And we can take inspiration from<br>
     individuals across the globe who are doing all they can to stem the toxic tide and advocate for long-term changes that<br>
      will permanently redefine our relationship with plastics.<br>
    To celebrate World Oceans Day, were profiling a few remarkable people who are fighting the good fight for our seas.</p>

<h3>--we are tryng to stop global warming--</h3>
<p>global warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries.<br>
     Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed observations of various weather phenomena<br>
      (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms) and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currents and the atmosphere’s<br>
       chemical composition). These data indicate that Earts climate has changed over almost every conceivable timescale since<br>
        the beginning of geologic time and that human activities since at least the beginning of the Industrial Revolution have a<br>
         growing influence over the pace and extent of present-day climate change.<br>
    The terms global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably, but climate change is a broader phenomenon.<br>
        Global warming refers only to the Earths rising surface temperature, while climate change includes warming and the<br>
        “side effects” of warming—like melting glaciers, heavier rainstorms, or more frequent drought. The causes of global warming<br>
        are complex, including natural. The Earths climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have<br>
         been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 7,000 years ago marking the<br>
          beginning of the modern climate era—and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small<br>
           variations in Earths orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. The current warming trend is of<br>
            particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of<br>
             human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.</p>
